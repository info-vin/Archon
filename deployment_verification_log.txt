# Deployment Verification Log for spike/verify-deployment-pipeline

## Date
2025-09-10

## Initial Test

### Action
1. Checked out `spike/verify-deployment-pipeline`.
2. Ran `docker compose --profile full up -d --build` to simulate deployment.
3. Ran `curl http://localhost:8181/health` to verify service health.

### Result: FAILURE
The deployment was successful in that the service started, but the service itself is not healthy because the database schema is out of date.

#### Health Check Output:
```json
{
  "status": "migration_required",
  "service": "archon-backend",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-10T04:58:18.859024",
  "ready": false,
  "migration_required": true,
  "message": "Database schema outdated - missing required columns from recent updates",
  "migration_instructions": "Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run: migration/add_source_url_display_name.sql",
  "schema_valid": false
}
```

### Analysis
The backend service started but is not in a ready state because the database schema is outdated. A migration needs to be run. The required migration script is `migration/add_source_url_display_name.sql`.

---

## Re-verification after Fix

### Action
1. User executed the database migration script `migration/add_source_url_display_name.sql` in Supabase.
2. Restarted Docker services.
3. Ran `curl http://localhost:8181/health` again.

### Result: SUCCESS
The health check was successful.

#### Health Check Output:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "archon-backend",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-10T05:54:08.260557",
  "ready": true,
  "credentials_loaded": true,
  "schema_valid": true
}
```

### Conclusion
The root cause of the deployment issue was confirmed to be the outdated database schema. Applying the necessary migration resolves the issue.
