# Deployment Verification Log for spike/verify-deployment-pipeline

## Date
2025-09-10

## Action
1. Checked out `spike/verify-deployment-pipeline`.
2. Ran `docker compose --profile full up -d --build` to simulate deployment.
3. Ran `curl http://localhost:8181/health` to verify service health.

## Result: FAILURE

The deployment was successful in that the service started, but the service itself is not healthy because the database schema is out of date.

### Health Check Output:
```json
{
  "status": "migration_required",
  "service": "archon-backend",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-10T04:58:18.859024",
  "ready": false,
  "migration_required": true,
  "message": "Database schema outdated - missing required columns from recent updates",
  "migration_instructions": "Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run: migration/add_source_url_display_name.sql",
  "schema_valid": false
}
```

### Analysis
The backend service started but is not in a ready state because the database schema is outdated. A migration needs to be run. The required migration script is `migration/add_source_url_display_name.sql`.
