docs: Refactor docs and internalize agent principles

This commit focuses on a major refactoring of the project's documentation and agent definitions based on historical lessons from GEMINI.md.

Key Changes:

1.  **Refactor `CONTRIBUTING_tw.md`**:
    -   The main body has been streamlined into a clear, actionable SOP, using the structure of the temporary `CONTRIBUTING_his.md`.
    -   All historical context, decision-making rationale, and "Chef's Notes" have been moved to a new "Appendix A", organized chronologically to serve as a professional architectural log.

2.  **Evolve `AGENTS.md`**:
    -   Removed versioning and integrated historical principles directly into each agent's workflow steps, rather than as separate lists.
    -   The "Process Improvement Expert" is now explicitly tasked with proposing modifications to other agents' workflows, creating a continuous learning loop.

3.  **Cleanup**:
    -   Removed the static statistics block from `GEMINI.md`.
    -   Deleted the now-redundant `CONTRIBUTING_his.md` and `deployment_verification_log.txt` files.
    -   Marked task 3.6.1 in `TODO.md` as complete.
