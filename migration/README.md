# Database Migrations

This directory contains SQL scripts for managing the database schema and seeding data.

## Schema Migrations

Numbered files (e.g., `20250827_add_new_features_schema.sql`) represent sequential changes to the database schema. They should be applied in order.

## Data Seeding

Files like `seed_mock_data.sql` are used to populate the database with initial or mock data for development and testing.

## Database Design Philosophy

For a detailed explanation of the "Aggregation Model" and the principles behind our database design, please refer to the main documentation site. This approach is central to how we structure and manage data in Archon.
